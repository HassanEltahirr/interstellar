# Cosmic Web App üåå

Welcome to the **Cosmic Web App**, a space-themed platform designed to educate and inspire users about the wonders of the universe. Dive into detailed descriptions, stunning visuals, and interactive sections that explore some of the most fascinating cosmic phenomena.

## üå† Features

### **Black Holes**
- **Description**: Explore the enigmatic regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
- **Highlights**:
  - **Event Horizon**: The boundary marking the point of no return.
  - **Singularity**: The infinitely dense center of a black hole.
  - **Hawking Radiation**: Theoretical radiation emitted due to quantum effects.

### **Neutron Stars**
- **Description**: Dense stellar remnants containing more mass than the Sun in a sphere only 20 kilometers in diameter.
- **Highlights**:
  - **Formation**: Created after a massive supernova explosion.
  - **Properties**: Incredibly dense with rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields.

### **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)**
- **Description**: The most energetic explosions in the universe, releasing more energy in seconds than the Sun will emit in its lifetime.
- **Highlights**:
  - **Short GRBs**: Likely caused by neutron star mergers.
  - **Long GRBs**: Associated with supernovae and massive star collapse.
